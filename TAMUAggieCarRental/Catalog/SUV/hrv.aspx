          None of the entries in our new subcompact SUV segment has stood clearly above the rest to earn an "A" rating. Many have fallen short for the very reasons we ultimately recommend the 2016 Honda HR-V: interior space and versatility. With a large, low and flexible cargo area facilitated by its flipping and folding "Magic" rear seat, the little HR-V can hold far more stuff than its rivals. It also offers generous rear passenger space, abundant features for the money, class-leading fuel economy and Honda's strong resale value. Unfortunately, acceleration is lethargic, the touchscreen controls can frustrate and some may find the driving position uncomfortable. But the HR-V is still among the best of this bunch.
