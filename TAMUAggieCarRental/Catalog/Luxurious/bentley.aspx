           True spontaneity is a luxury few enjoy. The Bentley Continental GT was conceived, designed and built for those who do – that rare breed of people who refuse to let single experience pass them by.
                            The new Continental GT sees its most significant upgrade for half a decade. It introduces a re-styled cabin and bodywork as well as reﬁnements to driver and passenger comfort that takes the world’s most stylish grand tourer to unparalleled new heights.
                            The range is made up of the even more powerful GT, the supreme GT Speed, the luxurious V8 and the agile V8 S. All available in a choice of coupé or convertible.
                                Bentley Continental. The luxury of spontaneity.
